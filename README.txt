SnackSafe

Ian Papeâ€™s Capstone 1 project.

        In this app the user may create an account, login and be directed to the users "Snack Safe" page.  
    From here you may see any saved food products or "snacks". If the user hasnt done any saving yet, click on the "Search" link in the navbar.  
    From there the User may type a food procuct in the search input, check any boxes of the top 8 allergens the user wants to avoid, as well as adding anything else the user may want to avoid in the "custom allergen" input. 
    The search will comb all branded foods in the USDA's Food Central Database, and return a list of cards containing foods the user searched for(if there are any) that do not contain any selected allergens. 
    On the food product cards returned from the result, one may click the link the view the full USDA nutrition info on that product, or click "Add to my Snack Safe!" to build up a list of safe snacks just for you.

        I myself have a tick bourne illness galled Alpha Gal Syndrome, which makes me allergic to mammal prodcuts like beef, pork and dairy.  
    Since beef ( or products derived from beef like gelatin) are not common allergens, this is a great way for me to search for foods and use a custom allergen input. 
    One may find this useful for religious reasons as well if one want to avoid non "allergens" like pork or beef.  One may also find it useful just for tastes preferences. 
    For instance, say I tend to find all store bought Salsas taste overwhelmingly of Cumin (which I do), just search for "salsa" and put "cumin" in the custom allergen input and voila! A list of Salsas with no cumin!

     Snack safe everyone!
